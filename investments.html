            <div class="post-title">Alamos Gold (AGI) — Established Canadian producer</div>
            <p class="post-excerpt">
              <strong>Why it’s on the list:</strong> Management guidance indicates a potential production ramp over the next several years (guidance is not a guarantee).
              The company has operating scale, cash-flow characteristics typical of an established producer, and a clearer cost framework.
            </p>
            <p class="post-excerpt">
              <strong>Key operational notes (as described):</strong> AISC discussed in the ~$1,200–$1,300 range; meaningful capex planned to expand output toward a larger annual profile,
              which can reduce near-term returns but may improve long-run earnings power if execution is strong.
            </p>
            <p class="post-excerpt">
              <strong>Primary risks:</strong> execution risk on growth plans, commodity-price volatility, cost inflation, and the usual mining operational risks.
            </p>

            <div class="post-title">Fortuna Mining (FSM) — Gold/Silver hybrid</div>
            <p class="post-excerpt">
              <strong>Why it’s on the list:</strong> A multi-asset producer with geographic diversification (Africa + South America, per your notes),
              which can reduce single-country exposure versus a one-jurisdiction operator.
            </p>
            <p class="post-excerpt">
              <strong>How to think about entries (framework, not advice):</strong> You referenced the “heartbeat” consolidation/breakout pattern and waiting for confirmation
              (breakout levels / highest close). This is a monitoring framework rather than a recommendation.
            </p>
            <p class="post-excerpt">
              <strong>Primary risks:</strong> jurisdictional and operational risk across multiple regions; commodity-price sensitivity; execution and cost control.

            <div class="post-title">Galiano Gold (GAU) — Turnaround small cap</div>
            <p class="post-excerpt">
              <strong>Why it’s on the list:</strong> Smaller market cap and “turnaround” characteristics can create asymmetric outcomes if the operating story improves.
              You highlighted exploration spending and targeted underground potential with notable grade commentary.
            </p>
            <p class="post-excerpt">
              <strong>What to watch:</strong> updated resource estimates, exploration results, and milestone delivery (these tend to move small caps disproportionately).
            </p>
            <p class="post-excerpt">
              <strong>Primary risks:</strong> single-asset concentration, operational disruption risk, and higher volatility typical of small caps.

            <div class="post-title">Newfound Gold (NFGC) — High-grade Canadian discovery</div>
            <p class="post-excerpt">
              <strong>Why it’s on the list:</strong> You cited extremely high grades relative to typical gold operations and a development timeline that—if successful—
              could be meaningful. High-grade discoveries can attract attention, capital, and strategic interest.
            </p>
            <p class="post-excerpt">
              <strong>Primary risks:</strong> pre-revenue development (financing and dilution risk), timeline slippage, permitting, and the gap between discovery excitement and
              economic mine development.
            </p>

            <div class="post-title">Vista Gold (VGZ) — Australian leverage play</div>
            <p class="post-excerpt">
              <strong>Why it’s on the list:</strong> Single-asset development exposure can behave like “pure leverage” to the gold price under the right conditions.
              You referenced a large, underdeveloped deposit and valuation sensitivity to gold-price assumptions.
            </p>
            <p class="post-excerpt">
              <strong>Primary risks:</strong> no operating revenue, long timelines (late-decade execution), financing requirements, and the reality that commodity-price leverage cuts both ways.
            </p>
          </article>

          <!-- 6) New Pacific Metals -->
          <article class="post-item">

            <div class="post-title">New Pacific Metals (NEWP) — Bolivia silver development</div>
            <p class="post-excerpt">
              <strong>Why it’s on the list:</strong> You framed this as the silver-side development exposure: large undeveloped projects can offer upside if silver is bullish
              and the project de-risks. You also noted improving site control/security dynamics.
            </p>
            <p class="post-excerpt">
              <strong>Primary risks:</strong> country/geopolitical risk (including nationalization history), community relations, and silver’s higher volatility versus gold.
              This category can be high-upside but requires strict risk sizing and monitoring.
